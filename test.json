Your job, quite simply, is to do what you're supposed to do the way you're supposed to do it. You might have ideas or inputs and you should bring that up but, if you sit there quietly fuming at how everything sucks and your manager is an idiot and the company is stupid, you're going to be miserable and not perform well.\n\nThere are also skills in choosing what work you do and deftly get out of doing things that you don't want to do or aren't good at, letting your manager know when you did something good, and not doing things that your manager didn't actually ask you to do while you secretly hope you somehow get \"credit\" for it. Your manager is very likely doing the same thing with their manager, and that manager as well. It's communication, and you have to learn ways to tell your manager quickly and effectively what you are and aren't doing and what your issues are.",

It wasn't fair. The goalposts were moved, suddenly I wasn't Too New to Rate, and my PTO used as a new hire to care for an immediate family member after serious surgery was counted against me at the bottom of the stack. I was PiPped without coaching plan on my first below.\n\nIt was a very stressful year. I fought hard and cared for my team to stay afloat and yet it happened. It was a very miserable experience that added to the stress of caring for someone with delicate health throughout the year.\n\nBefore I was laid off, I started getting psychiatric help, antidepressant treatment. I was already undergoing behavioral therapy but the stress was too much for that alone. After being PiPped and opting out (always opt out, not worth trying to meet a PiP).\n\nThe first month I couldnt wake up early. I slept in so much, and I am the kind of guy who's weightlifting at 7am. I was frustrated for not being able to stick to a schedule. \"Your body is burnt out\", the psychiatrist explained, getting into the details of how prolonged stress is not just mental and how it leads to inflammation and damage of nerves, opening up to serious stuff down the line. My physicla performance at weights and running also plumetted \"Stress was your fuel\" I was told. Yes, stress is a big motivator for the body and it physically puts you on overdrive, but it is meant to be used in tempoeary bouts, not as your standard fuel. \"Now, everything you do will be based off of your own willpower, and that's why it's harder; you are not used to it\".\n\nThe next four months were such a life changing recovery for me. Yes, I did all the unemployment, interviewing, referrals etc and very thankfully landed a job. But it was so surprising how much I could just, focus on the task at hand and not burning stress fuel. I felt like I was severely limited on my abilities due to stress before.\n\nTo avoid dragging the topic for too long, ai want to share my takeaways with you:\n- Stress is not just mental, it WILL turn into physical illness more than you think. You realize its severity once you start recovering from it.\n- No toxic job is worth it, ever. Im not telling you to quit on the spot (with some notable exceptions), but start looking now.\n- Never EVER measure your worth as a professional on stack ranking. There are many factors in play, often out of your reach. Communicate often, keep learning, be respectful, and do your best.\n- Be compassionate with yourself as you recover, it's okay to step away from the hustle.\n- Avoid catastrophizing, it is stressful to lose a job, but you will survive.\n- Seek psychological/psychiatric help. I started with therapy but my body was so chemically addicted to stress that I had to get additional help, and that's okay.\n- Dont work for Capital One unless you absolutely have to.\n\nAgain, take what you need, drop the rest.

        "SUBMISSION_BODY": "I've been working as a front end developer the last 8 years now for 3 different companies. I've always enjoyed working on the front end more and like interacting directly with the interface. I've also done some UX design work and enjoyed that previously as well.\n\nI was laid off last month and am on the job hunt looking for my next role. Each time I look for a new role it seems like there are less and less front end positions available. This time especially so, and I understand the job market has something to do with that as well. But it seems the trend is to replace FE devs with full stack. Why pay 2 people the same amount if you can pay 1 for the same amount of work?\n\nWith all the no code and low code tools that are out there today, I see the front end being the first dev jobs to get fully automated by AI in the near future. All of this is making me think I should take the time to upskill to becoming a full stack engineer, or get a certification in machine learning and become an ML engineer. My thoughts here are that it'd be less likely to get automated out of my job if I have the skill set to write and train these AI models. But everybody and their mother are becoming ML engineers right now so it'll likely be an even more competitive landscape than applying for FE roles (where it's a challenge to stand out and distinguish yourself from all the other FE devs with the same skills).\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my situation? Stick to what I enjoy most? Learn backend and switch to full stack? Then dive into ML? Would a ML certification not be enough to stand out, and it would require me to get a masters? I'm not as interested in going back to school if I don't have to. \n\nAny success stories you'd like to share about how you successfully transitioned into a different dev role before?",

I ask for a reasonable salary, he says \"I can get you more than that dude\" and says they'd pay $15k over what I asked. He's very fast in scheduling interviews and I'm never left waiting for a call back.\n\nSounds great, right?\n\nThen comes the final round - a video interview with the manager. I wake up early, shave, put on my interview suit & tie, pull up my resume and the job listing in my side monitor, etc. I join the call and the manager is... late. After about 5min (to be fair: not very long) he joins the call in what appear to be his pajamas. He begins asking questions. I start to answer, and ask a clarifying question (think \"how would you solve XYZ?\" / \"that depends, does ABC?\") and instead of answering my clarifying question he rolls his eyes and just tells me the answer to his question. This happens again 2-3 times throughout the interview. All the while he rarely ever looks at me - he's very clearly doing something else the entire time. The last question he asks me is \"You play videogames? Xbox or Playstation?\" and then he ends the call with your standard \"we'll let you know\". \n\nFrankly I found the entire thing wildly unprofessional. I'm no prude but I have an expectation of some level of courtesy and I think this behavior was quite inappropriate for a job interview. Part of me wonders if it was a race thing. It was like he got one look at me (or saw my name) and immediately disregarded me.\n\nAnyway, things worked out - I ended up accepting an offer for 35k more at a much cooler tech company, and CarGurus is starting to get a negative reputation in Boston because people think [their new HQ](https://i.imgur.com/EPWjodS.png) is an eyesore.

It's no longer the case.\n\nIf you have just done bachelors, you will have a big learning curve once you join the company. Many companies that have their own tools and stuff take into account training for new people. Unfortunately not all companies and not all people in the team you would join will have the time or the skill to reach you.\n\nExample, we realized that one person in our group doesn't have computer architecture background. Coincidentally everyone in our team does. The computing platforms and everything around it today is far more complex than what it was 5-6 years ago. We hadn't hired and junior engineers in a long time. Since comp architecture isn't exactly a core topic we directly work on , no one realized how difficult it would be for someone to work in our team without it's background.\nWe made a list of things he needs to learn. He has been doing some evaluation and came back that he found no bachelor level courses that covers these topics and it's a grad school course.\n\nFrankly, just look at all the job postings and see how much of it can be worked out with just bachelors degrees.\n\nFor AI/ML, many don't even hire without PhD.\n\nThe new field we are moving into, is completely new. They are only hiring people who can come up with stuff. That means there no people who know the stuff yet themselves much less teach it to a new hire.\n\nJust go try to buy a TV or fridge or anything and picture what went into engineering it and transporting it through supply chain and all the business aspect of it across all the geography involved.",

I've been working for the NYS government as a programmer for about a year and 3 months now after graduating in May of 2023. I graduated with a BS in comp sci with a high GPA, an internship, a few projects and a wide knowledge of languages and SE concepts like Scrum so I thought I would easily get a job somewhere and just grow from there. Oh how full of hubris I was. 300 applications later and I had nothing but rejections and ghosting until I applied to the State and got in. While it's not perfect, it's definitely not horrible:\n\n* I get health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance and life insurance all for like $80 biweekly\n* In NYS at least, workers are unionized so I get certain protections against being fired and salary increases. Don't know if other states allow state workers to be unionized. The union gives us pay raises every year\n*  I work from home Fridays and Mondays, some other agencies that employ IT guys can get up 50% WFH biweekly\n* The work is very easy: most of the time after I'm done with something there isn't anything else for me to do even if I ask so I just sit around and do whatever, sometimes I actually try to do something productive like learning React but other times I just hang out\n* State has a 457(b) plan which is like a 401(k) to save for retirement, as well as a great pension if you stay with them for a long time\n* The work you do actually benefits people, one app I worked on was used by 60,000 New Yorkers to help them register to save on school taxes which is so gratifying to think about how what I do directly impacts people\n* Some state governments are basically begging for workers, there's a stigma against working in the public sector mainly due to the pay, but that means that there's always open positions\n* I get to say I work for the government when people ask me what I do which is pretty cool\n\nBiggest complaint I have is the salary, there is a lot to be desired there. I currently make $65000 and am living in an expensive area so it kinda sucks but the aforementioned benefits definitely make up for it. Union raises aren't much, maybe $3k a year, but the higher salary you have the more you get for raises, so next year I'll be getting a bigger raise. I'm still able to pay rent, utilities, car insurance, student  loans and save some money. With how the job market looks right now, I'm content with staying here and getting 3+ years of experience so I can be a mid level dev by the time the job market goes back to at least some kind of normal. \n\nI've made peace that I'm not able to work at a FANG company or whatever that acronym is and honestly at this point I really don't care. Life is a lot less stressful when you're not trying to memorize some Leetcode problems or compete in a FANG company application rat race.

I've been working for the NYS government as a programmer for about a year and 3 months now after graduating in May of 2023. I graduated with a BS in comp sci with a high GPA, an internship, a few projects and a wide knowledge of languages and SE concepts like Scrum so I thought I would easily get a job somewhere and just grow from there. Oh how full of hubris I was. 300 applications later and I had nothing but rejections and ghosting until I applied to the State and got in. While it's not perfect, it's definitely not horrible:\n\n* I get health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance and life insurance all for like $80 biweekly\n* In NYS at least, workers are unionized so I get certain protections against being fired and salary increases. Don't know if other states allow state workers to be unionized. The union gives us pay raises every year\n*  I work from home Fridays and Mondays, some other agencies that employ IT guys can get up 50% WFH biweekly\n* The work is very easy: most of the time after I'm done with something there isn't anything else for me to do even if I ask so I just sit around and do whatever, sometimes I actually try to do something productive like learning React but other times I just hang out\n* State has a 457(b) plan which is like a 401(k) to save for retirement, as well as a great pension if you stay with them for a long time\n* The work you do actually benefits people, one app I worked on was used by 60,000 New Yorkers to help them register to save on school taxes which is so gratifying to think about how what I do directly impacts people\n* Some state governments are basically begging for workers, there's a stigma against working in the public sector mainly due to the pay, but that means that there's always open positions\n* I get to say I work for the government when people ask me what I do which is pretty cool\n\nBiggest complaint I have is the salary, there is a lot to be desired there. I currently make $65000 and am living in an expensive area so it kinda sucks but the aforementioned benefits definitely make up for it. Union raises aren't much, maybe $3k a year, but the higher salary you have the more you get for raises, so next year I'll be getting a bigger raise.

But if it's not? That means you were being waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay underpaid for your role.\n\nIf you decide to take the money I wouldn't just take the money and call it a day. Sit down with your manager and any other stakeholders and explain your reasons for leaving and any changes you expect to happen as a result of agreeing to stay. I would also make sure the retention bonus doesn't have any sort of clawback hooks or a vesting schedule, and if it's the latter either get them to drop the vesting schedule or allow quarterly vesting of some kind. They're offering you more money, so get that money and make sure it's as permanent as possible as quickly as possible.\n\nFinally: remember, they're offering you this because you leaving is likely going to blow a pretty big hole in their department, so while it's in your best interest to make it worth your while, you're also \"marked\" and if they have to reduce staff for some reason you may be first in line for those reductions. They could be offering you this and all the while are searching for your replacement(s) with the intention of canning you once they feel they've found enough gullible folks to do your job.\n\nFinally finally: GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING.

Also, bonus payment in writing which makes it clear it doesn't have any riders or just demand they pay it immediately. Personally I don't like stress and suffering but I also really like money, and I think I'd be willing to abuse my brain for a while if it paid good money. The stress is also workable. I think the easiest way to handle it is to accept that getting fired is the worst-case scenario and it isn't that bad.\n\nThis type of stuff does have a tendency to destroy relationships.

        "SUBMISSION_BODY": "I\u2019m a freshman (first semester) and just had a midterm intro to CS. Our midterm was to write a program that asks the users for a series of integers and to print the highest and lowest number but the catch is there\u2019s only 15 minutes and we can\u2019t use booleans, arrays, special methods etc. Only ifs and loops. It works for the most part but there\u2019s some bugs: for instance if a user enters 3,4,5,6 it will say the highest is 6 and the lowest is 0 which was initialized. I also forgot to delete an unused variable. Almost no kid actually solved it on their own but so many kids chatgpted it when the professor idiotically took a bathroom break. The curve is cooked. And I\u2019m miserably cooked. What grade do you guys think I\u2019ll be getting? Probably a 60 at best\u2026 \n\nEDIT: for context (because ostensibly a majority of repliers think otherwise) the code works. It stops and outputs when the sentinel value is entered, informs the user of invalid input when a negative integer is entered, and outputs a maximum and minimum number of their series for *some* cases. The error lies in the fact that max and min initializations were set to 0 and the first number would only go to max, meaning if a number smaller than any previous numbers entered was not inputted, minimum would always be 0. If the series: 4,3,5 were entered it would work, but if the series: 3,4,5 were entered it wouldn\u2019t. It was a silly error (made by the lack of my edge case testing) not setting the first value to min and max by initializing min and max as extremities but it still accomplishes the task albeit ineffective and inefficient. \n\nEDIT 2: Today I did some leetcode easies (first time on leetcode) which were relatively more difficult than this. I did palindromes, counting substrings, concatenation of arrays, max/min operations for divisibility, and so on.

Our midterm was to write a program that asks the users for a series of integers and to print the highest and lowest number but the catch is there\u2019s only 15 minutes and we can\u2019t use booleans, arrays, special methods etc. Only ifs and loops. It works for the most part but there\u2019s some bugs: for instance if a user enters 3,4,5,6 it will say the highest is 6 and the lowest is 0 which was initialized.

The error lies in the fact that max and min initializations were set to 0 and the first number would only go to max, meaning if a number smaller than any previous numbers entered was not inputted, minimum would always be 0. If the series: 4,3,5 were entered it would work, but if the series: 3,4,5 were entered it wouldn\u2019t.

And especially since bathroom breaks aren't typically allowed on an exam aka take exam in one sitting. \n\n2. stupid enough to let their students have network access during a CS exam of all things? Why didn't they work with the IT dept to block/disable web access or use detectors to see if students opened a search engine/accessed ChatGPT and other help sites like that?? Isn't the OP's class supposed to be a computer class ffs? lmao.\n\nThis policy should've also applied to student phones as well.  Enforce a class policy of all student phones being turned off and stored in their bags.  Stored in a visible location away from students etc.\n\nSMFH.  Seems that instructor needs to get fired for professional incompetency. He failed in teaching as a CS professional in his job as a university professor. And he's also directly responsible for producing and adding some of most programming illiterate CS majors to the IT job pool. Because if all of his students to date are completely incapable of programming simple if statements/for loops, then the SWE industry is cooked.\n\nCollege has produced an average 100K CS grads nationwide since 2019. That figure was about 108K last year. That's before factoring Bootcamps (with their highly questionable front end web dev curriculum) which dumped some 290K grads on the market last year. So post secondary and Bootcamp institutions unceremoniously dumped just under HALF A MILLION CS/IT grads into the job market last year. With not much change expected for this year. \n\nSo the market's hyper saturation of unemployed CS/SWE applicants v the undersupply of entry level jobs is beyond the butt of a joke to date.  Especially since the staginflated market has led IT industry employers to remain biased in their hiring of mid to Sr level professionals to date. SWE professionals who btw, were recently laid off from Big Tech like Meta/Amazon and Main St like Intel etc.  Which has contributed to the unemployment line of entry level SWE/CS applicants growing towards infinity to date. \n\nSo it's going to take A LONG TIME ---regardless whether the IT sector rebounds after the election or not---to clear this clusterfuKK of SWE job applicants in the market. And the forecast outlook by the US Bureau of Labor over the next 10 years is even more depressing...\n\nTL DR  those students who cheated using ChatGPT are responsible for the clusterfuKK of unemployed job applicants in the market to date. All thanks to idiot CS professors like the OP's who completely failed to hold their students accountable.  Instructors like that are a driving factor behind the 6mo - 1yr+ unemployment job seeking time it's taking a lot of CS grads to find work.\n\nBecause instructors like that are responsible for producing CS grads who are literally programming illiterate. It's no wonder so many CS job applicants cry about being unable to pass the technical part of their coding interviews.

Don't wory about the internship, throw the feeling of being behind out, be present and set goals. work now towards what you can look back on 6 months later and be proud.
